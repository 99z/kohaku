## requirements

* Ruby 2.x or higher

* an Imagga (https://imagga.com) account

## usage

1. clone this repo / download the .zip
2. open your preferred terminal emulator in the `kohaku` directory
3. type `ruby kohaku.rb`

## TODO:

* create readme banner :)

* ...and create a better readme

* comments

* support for multiple file formats

* rspec tests / general error handling

* gemify

* allow user to specify how many tags to use when renaming

* directory checking to make sure user doesn't rename images in accidentally incorrect directory

* multiple modes for more precise image tagging, e.g. 'wallpaper' mode will always include 'wallpaper' for one of the tags applied to images in a directory

* maybe combine with cloudsight api?
